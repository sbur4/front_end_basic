                    <div class="section-content" id="html_and_accessibility">
                        <p>As you learn more about HTML — read more resources, look at more examples, etc. — you'll keep seeing a common theme: the importance of using semantic HTML (sometimes called POSH, or Plain Old Semantic HTML). This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.</p>
                        <p>You might wonder why this is so important. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want. For example, a control button to play a video on your site could be marked up like this:</p>
                        <p>Not only do HTML <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s have some suitable styling applied by default (which you will probably want to override), they also have built-in keyboard accessibility — users can navigate between buttons using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and activate their selection using <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
                        <p>Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Easier to develop with</strong> — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Better on mobile</strong> — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Good for SEO</strong> — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let's get on and look at accessible HTML in more detail.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>
                <section aria-labelledby="good_semantics">
                    <h3>
                        <a href="#good_semantics" title="Permalink to Good Semantic">
                            Good semantics
                        </a>
                    </h3>
                    <div class="section-content" id="good_semantics">
                        <p>We've already talked about the importance of proper semantics, and why we should use the right HTML element for the job. This cannot be ignored, as it is one of the main places that accessibility is badly broken if not handled properly.</p>
                        <p>Out there on the web, the truth is that people do some very strange things with HTML markup. Some abuses of HTML are due to legacy practices that have not been completely forgotten, and some are just plain ignorance. Whatever the case, you should replace such bad code.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes you are not in the position to get rid of lousy markup — your pages might be generated by some kind of server-side framework over which you don't have full control, or you might have third party content on your page (such as ad banners) over which you have no control.</p>
                        <p>The goal isn't "all or nothing"; every improvement you can make will help the cause of accessibility.</p>
                    </div>

                    <section aria-labelledby="text_content">
                        <h4>
                            <a href="#text_content" title="Permalink to Text content">Text content</a>
                        </h4>
                        <div class="section-content" id="text_content">
                            <p>One of the best accessibility aids a screen reader user can have is an excellent content structure with headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. An excellent semantic example might look something like the following:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The screen reader reads each header out as you progress through the content, notifying you what a heading is, what is a paragraph, etc.</li>
                                <li>It stops after each element, letting you go at whatever pace is comfortable for you.</li>
                                <li>You can jump to the next/previous heading in many screen readers.</li>
                                <li>You can also bring up a list of all headings in many screen readers, allowing you to use them as a handy table of contents to find specific content.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>People sometimes write headings, paragraphs, etc. using presentational HTML and line breaks, something like the following:</p>
                            <p>There are other issues too beyond accessibility — it is harder to style the content using CSS, or manipulate it with JavaScript, for example, because there are no elements to use as selectors.</p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    
                    <section aria-labelledby="page_layouts">
                        <h4>
                            <a href="#page_layouts" title="Permalink to Page layouts">Page layouts</a>
                        </h4>
                        <div class="section-content" id="page_layouts">

                            <figure>
                                <img src="./images/code-example.PNG" alt="Modern website structure example">
                                <figcaption>Modern website structure example</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>In the bad old days, people used to create page layouts using HTML tables — using different table cells to contain the header, footer, sidebar, main content column, etc. This is not a good idea because a screen reader will likely give out confusing readouts, especially if the layout is complex and has many nested tables.</p>
                            <p>Try our example <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/table-layout.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">table-layout.html</a> example, which looks something like this:</p>
                            <p>If you try to navigate this using a screen reader, it will probably tell you that there's a table to be looked at (although some screen readers can guess the difference between table layouts and data tables). You'll then likely (depending on which screen reader you're using) have to go down into the table as an object and look at its features separately, then get out of the table again to carry on navigating the content.</p>
                            <p>Table layouts are a relic of the past — they made sense back when CSS support was not widespread in browsers, but now they just create confusion for screen reader users. Additionally, their source code requires more markup, which makes them less flexible and more difficult to maintain. You can verify these claims by comparing your previous experience with a <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/document_and_website_structure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more modern website structure example</a>, which could look something like this:</p>
                            <!-- Add image with code example here -->
                            <p>If you try our more modern structure example with a screen reader, you'll see that the layout markup no longer gets in the way and confuses the content readout. It is also much leaner and smaller in terms of code size, which means easier to maintain code, and less bandwidth for the user to download (particularly prevalent for those on slow connections).</p>
