# Accessibility fundamentals and HTML semantic

## Change old-fashioned layout to create fancy landing and meet best practice of accessibility approach

## Before we start

1.	This practical task is verified automatically with tests.
2.	Please put all your `HTML` code in the `src/index.html` and `src/gallery.html` file. If you use any other file, we will not be able to verify it.
3. Please, don't change the page structure, it may affect tests.

## Development

While developing, you can open `src/index.html` in your browser to check it. However, we have prepared a more convenient way to run it locally, you can find the details here: [Local Development](https://gitlab.com/gap-bs-front-end-autocode-documents/autocode-documents/-/blob/main/docs/LocalDevelopment.md).

## Check your solution before submitting it (OPTIONAL)

To be sure you submit a correct solution, you can verify it locally. This requires some local setup. Here are the instructions: [Verify your solution locally](https://gitlab.com/gap-bs-front-end-autocode-documents/autocode-documents/-/blob/main/docs/VerifySolutionLocally.md).

## Task Requirements

Replace non-semantic elements with proper semantic tags to make your web page more sophisticated. 

Please note you should edit the `src/index.html` file. Your solution cannot be verified if you use a different file.
